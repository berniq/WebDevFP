  Emily thrives in environments that let her showcase her creativity and personality. The platform should allow her to personalize her experience—whether through customized profiles, themed backgrounds, or the ability to share makeup tutorials, personal stories, or fashion tips. Features like interactive filters or a fun, creative space will keep her engaged.
- **Peer Validation & Social Comparison:**  
  Emily is motivated by peer validation and recognition. Likes, shares, and comments play an important role in shaping how she interacts with content.

- **Social Influence and Trends:**  
  Emily is highly influenced by her peer group and current trends. She loves being the first to adopt new challenges or viral content. The platform should support discovery features, such as a trending section, or tools that let her jump into viral challenges easily.

  As a 14-year-old, Emily is still learning how to navigate privacy concerns. The platform should offer robust parental control features to ensure her safety while allowing her to express herself freely. Clear privacy settings and tools that let her control who sees her posts (friends only, public, etc.) will make her feel more secure. A "Safe Mode" for younger users could provide peace of mind for both Emily and her parents.
- **Learning & Discovery:**  
  While Emily loves social interaction, she also enjoys learning new things like makeup techniques or trends. The platform can offer curated learning content or tutorials based on her interests, allowing her to further explore her passions.

  Emily is very much into influencers and looks up to them. She often looks for role models within the beauty and fashion space. The platform should have easy ways for her to follow influencers, watch live streams, and interact with them. Mentorship-style interactions—such as live Q&A sessions or influencer-led tutorials—would create additional engagement opportunities.
